# Text Summarization using NLP

Text summarization is the process of extracting the most important information from a source text.
This Python application provides a simple and user-friendly interface for summarizing text using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. It utilizes the SpaCy library for text processing and tkinter for the graphical user interface (GUI).

## Why automatic text summarization?
1.   Summaries reduce reading time.
2.   When researching documents,summaries make the  selection process easier.
3.   Automatic summarization improves the effectiveness of indexing.
4.   Automatice summarization algorithms are less biased than human summarization.
5.   Personalized summaries are useful in question-answering systems as they provied personalized information.
6.   Using automatic or semi-automatic summarization systems enables commercial abstract services to increase the number of text documents they are able to process.

## How to do text summarization(in the ML-Model)

*   Text cleaning
*   Sentence tokenization
*   Word tokenzation
*   Word-frequency table
*   Summarization


## Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python installed. If not, you can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using `git clone https://github.com/Bhudil/TxtSumm.git`.
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd TxtSumm`.
3. Install the required packages.

## Usage

Run the application by executing `Text_Summarization_NLP_UI.ipynb`.

1. Enter the text you want to summarize in the input text box.
2. Click the **Summarize** button to generate the summary.
3. The summarized text will be displayed in the output text box.
4. Click the **Copy to Clipboard** button to copy the summary for later use.

## Customization

You can modify the appearance and behavior of the GUI, such as fonts, colors, or the summarization algorithm, by editing the `Text_Summarization_NLP_UI.ipynb` file.
